# Data Types

In computer science and computer programming, a data type (or simply type) is a
collection or grouping of data values, usually specified by a set of possible
values, a set of allowed operations on these values, and/or a representation of
these values as machine types.[1] A data type specification in a program
constrains the possible values that an expression, such as a variable or a
function call, might take. On literal data, it tells the compiler or
interpreter how the programmer intends to use the data.
