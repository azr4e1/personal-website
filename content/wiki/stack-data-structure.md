# Stack Data Structure
The stack is a computer science data structure [data-structures](/wiki/data-structures/) which is like a pile of books:
you can take thinks on the top of the stack and put things on the top of the
stack, but you can't access anything for the remainder of the stack. This is
what is called LIFO stack - Last In, First Out.

A stack is an abstract data type that serves as a collection of elements. The stack will have several operations:

- push (add element to the top)
- pop (removes from the top)
- peek (return item at the top without changing the stack)

A stack may be implemented to have a bounded capacity. If the stack is full and
does not contain enough space to accept another element, the stack is in a
state of [stack-overflow](/wiki/stack-overflow/).
