WebAssembly is a type of code that can be run in modern web browsers â€” it is a low-level assembly-like language with a compact binary format that runs with near-native performance and provides languages such as C/C++, C# and Rust with a compilation target so that they can run on the web. It is also designed to run alongside JavaScript, allowing both to work together.

It provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so.

WASM was included in W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 2019. It includes a low-level language similar to assembly, that can be represented with text. This can then be converted into binary format and be run on all modern browsers.

You won't write this code directly, but rather use it as compilation target for programs written in other languages - C, C++, Go, etc.
