An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions. Algorithms are always unambiguous and are used as specifications for real world implementations.

An algorithm is:

- Defined: there is a specific sequence of steps that performs a task
- Unambiguous: there is a "correct" and "incorrect" interpretation of the steps
- Implementable: it can be performed in code or using hardware
