The heart can be stopped following trauma at a very specific point in its cycle. This is called _commotio cordis_.

The body region of interest here is the precordium, the area of the chest wall lying directly above the heart.

The precordium is a shield, made of the ribs and their muscles, which inflate and deflate our chest. Further swaddling is provided by the pericardium, a sac of membranes interposed with cuffs of shock-absorbing fat and fluid.

Impacts on these region may trigger commotio cordis. However the timing window for this to happen is small, as it must occur in a very specific section of the heartâ€™s electrical rhythm, making the likelihood around 1/100.

This makes commotio cordis a rarity, but nonetheless significant. The disruption of the cardiac cycle here can lead to a severe, potentially lethal rhythmic disorder. This is known as ventricular fibrillation. Medical teams must act quickly, using chest compressions, adrenaline and resuscitation with a defibrillator to restore a normal cardiac rhythm.

In some situations, blows in this area can actually restart a heart.

Historically, part of the algorithm for treating a patient in cardiac arrest was to first strike the precordium once using the base of a clenched fist. This is called a precordial thump. The reason why this could work is the same behind commotio cordis: mechanical energy that turns into tiny electrical currents. However some studies have found no benefit for its use at all.
