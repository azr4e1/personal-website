Ad frequency is how many times a customer sees your ad on average [facebook-ad-frequency](/wiki/facebook-ad-frequency/). These may be different ads, but all related to the same product.

In a meta-analysis by researchers Schmidt and Eisend (2015), it was found the in experimental settings maximum attitude is reached at aten exposures, while recall increases linearly and doesn't level off before the eigth exposure. In field settings this is probably higher.

For products that require low involvment like food, higher exposure may be necessary to get into the customer's brain. For products that require high engagement, like high quality, expensive items, lower exposure is sufficient as the customer is already aware of the product.

Spacing is also fundamental in increasing ad recall, by allowing the customer to process information.

Keep in mind that decay effects will lower ad recall of your campaigns.
