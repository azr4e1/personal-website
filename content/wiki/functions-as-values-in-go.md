# Functions as values in Go
In Go, functions are values. We can do anything with a function that we could do with a value; we can:
- assign a function to a variable or struct field
- pass a function as an argument to another function
- return a function as the result from another function


To declare a variable with a function type, we can write:
```go
var function func(float64, float64) float64
```

We've declared a variable named `function` whose type is `func(float64, float64) float64`
