# Continue and Break in For loops in Go
If we want to skip onto the next element in succession in a for loop, we can use the `continue` keyword:
```go
for _, el := range employees {
  if !e.IsCurrent {
    continue
  }
  e.PrintCheck()
}
```

When we need to terminate the loop early, we can use the `break` keyword:
```go
for _, e := range employees {
    if MoneyLeft() <= 0 {
        fmt.Println("Oops, out of cash!")
        break
    }
    ... // otherwise, print check
}
```

As soon as Go encounters a break statement, it immediately stops the loop and jumps to the code immediately following the closing brace at the end of the for statement.
