# Early return
Early return is a design patter that combines with the [happy-path](/wiki/happy-path/) design pattern. When a function deviates from the happy path, we include a return inside the deviation so that the function interrupts.

```go
if x <= 0 {
    fmt.Println("Nope, x is zero or negative")
    return false
}
```

Itâ€™s clear that if the function gets past this point, the condition must have been false, or we would have returned already.


This often makes `else` statements pointless
