The Go compiler won't let us declare a variable that we never refer to again (it correctly infers that this must be a mistake)

Sometimes however we _need_ a variable syntactically, as in the left-hand side of an assignment statement: in this case, we can use the _blank identifier_ `_` to act as a placeholder.

For example, if we're only interested into knowing whether a key is present in a map or not, we can write
```go
_, ok := menu["eggs"]
```
