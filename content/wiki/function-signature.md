# Function signature

A function signature (or method signature) includes the name, inputs, and outputs of a function or method.

If you change the function signature of a parent class when overriding a method, it could be a disaster. The whole point of overriding a method is so that the caller of your code doesn't have to worry about what different things are going on inside the methods of different object types.
