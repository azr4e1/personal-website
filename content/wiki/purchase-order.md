A purchase order (PO) is a legally binding document created by a buyer and
presented to a seller. Much like a shopping cart, a PO contains all the items
the buyer wants to purchase from the seller, laying out the order details,
including quantity and types of products the buyer needs, as well as payment
terms and delivery details.

A PO is a contract between buyer and seller. The buyer is committing to
purchasing goods or services for the agreed amount. This gives the seller
insurance against non-payment.
