# Data structures

A data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that
enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is
a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or
operations that can be applied to the data.

In other words, a data structure:

1. Stores data
2. Organizes data in such a way that we can read and modify it quickly
3. Implements algorithmic functions that expose the ability to read and modify the data
