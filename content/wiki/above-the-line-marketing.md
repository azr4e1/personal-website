Above the line marketing, also called ATL advertising, is a less focused marketing technique that reaes a larger/wider targer audience. This is a more old-school approach that boosts brand awareness. ATL advertsiting strategies include:

- Television
- Radio
- Billboards
- Newspaper and magazines

These mass media promotions allow you to reach a large audience but can cost more than BLT [below-the-line-marketing](/wiki/below-the-line-marketing/) techniques and don't utilise specialised data on your business's target audience. ATL methods suit large corporations aiming to build a well-known brand
