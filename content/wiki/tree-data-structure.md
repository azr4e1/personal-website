A tree is a widely used data structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure, with a root value and subtrees of children with a parent node, represented as a set of linked nodes.

A tree is a collection of nodes starting at a root or head node, similar to how a linked list was a collection of nodes starting with a head (root). The big difference between a LL and a tree is that a tree's nodes can have multiple children instead of just one.

A generic tree structure has the following rules:

- Each node has a value and a list of "children"
- Children can only have a single "parent"
- Duplicate values are allowed, multiple nodes can have the same value
