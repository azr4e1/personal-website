A good way to approach software development is to think in the shoes of our future users. We need to think how our users would approach and use our software. These are called _user stories_, because each of them tell a little story about a user and something they want to do. Sometimes people talk about features instead, but this doesnâ€™t necessarily make clear that all the work we do on the program should be aimed at interactions with users in some way. And there are lots of features a program could have that are in fact of no interest or value to users.

There are many stories we could think about. However, when starting out a project, we need to think about the stories we __couldn't__ possibly leave out: these are the _core_ stories of our project.
