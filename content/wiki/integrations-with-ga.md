As seen before in [link-google-ads-and-ga](/wiki/link-google-ads-and-ga/), you can integrate GA with Google Ads to export audiences and use conversions for smart bidding.

You can also integrate GA with other tools of the Google Marketing Platform like:
- Display and Video 360 (manage display and video campaigns, bids, creatives and audiences)
- Search Ads 360 (manage search campaigns across Google Ads, Bing, Yahoo, Baidu and more)
- Google Optimize (test variants of web pages and see how they perform)
- Firebase (build apps)
- Search Console (tools and reports that help you measure your site's Search traffic and performance, fix issues, and make your site shine in Google Search results)

with similar benefits as with Google Ads
