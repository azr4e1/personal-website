Advertising workspace is the fourth section of any GA property. It contains the following sections:
- Advertising snapshot: helps you better understand customer journeys and conversion performance. Ust it to answer questions like:
  - What roles did prior referrals, searches and ads play in conversions?
  - How much time passed between a customer's initial interest and their purchase?
  - What are the most common paths customers take leading up to conversions?
- All channels: Channels represent groups of traffic sources. Conversions are attributed to each channel based on the Admin property-level attribution settings
- Model Comparison: Attribution is the act of assigning credit for conversions to different ads, clicks and factors along user's paths. An Attribution Model is the rule/set of rules, that determines how credit is assigned to touch points in conversion paths. The Model comparison report can help you compare two different attribution models side-by-side.
- Conversion paths: it can help you understand customer journeys across web and apps. It will show you:
  - paths that led to conversions
  - number of conversions that results from each path
  - time to conversion
  - value of those conversion
