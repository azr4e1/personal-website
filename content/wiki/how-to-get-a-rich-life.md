  Spend extravagantly on the things that you love, but cut mercilessly on the things that you don't love.

In order to craft your rich life, you need to track your [key-metrics-for-personal-finance](/wiki/key-metrics-for-personal-finance/). You need to be able to tell very specifically what your rich life looks like, e.g. you want to travel six weeks a year, you want to own a yacht, you want to stay in a hotels, etc. And from there adjust your metrics based on this goals.

A goal without a plan is just a fantasy.
