# Gross Rating Point
In advertising, a __Gross Rating Point__ (GRP) measures the size of an audience that an advertisement impacts. GRPs help answer _how often_ must someone see it before they can readily recall it, and how many times does it take before the desired outcome occurs

GRPs are used predominantly as a measure of media with high potential exposures of impressions.

One GRP is one percent of all potential adult television viewers in a market. If they are exposed to the ad three times, then that is 3 GRPs.

GRPs are total impressions related to the size of the target population:

```latex
GRPs(\%) = 100 * Total Impressions (#) / Defined population (#)
GRPs(\%) = 100 * Reach (\%) / Average frequency (#)
```

Example: If 100,000 ad impressions are displayed on multiple episodes or TV stations for a defined population of 100,000 people, the total is 100 GRPs. However, total reach is not always 100%.
