There are long-format and wide-format data tables.
- long-format: every row only contains one measure of a subject for a given dependent variables. Subjects have to be replicated across different lines to encode all the measures related to the subjects. These are easy to write in log-files for experiments.
- wide-format: each row contains all of the measures for a given subject.
