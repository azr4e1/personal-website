# Exploration vs Exploitation

Should I go for the decision that seems to be optimal, assuming that my current knowledge is reliable enough? Or should I go for a decision that seems to be sub-optimal for now, making the assumption that my knowledge could be inaccurate and that gathering new information could help me to improve it?

__Exploitation__ consists of taking the decision assumed to be optimal given the data in our possession so far.

__Exploration__ consists of taking a sub-optimal choice with the explicit goal of collecting more data in order to make a better and more informed decision in the future.

This dilemma appears in every observation based decision-making process where there is a feedback loop (observation drives decision, decision drives new observations).

This kind of _online learning_ process is required either when there is not enough data to train a model (cold start problem) or when data evolved through time (non-stationary problem).

Either way, the data we have is not enough to identify the best decision with 100% certainty.
