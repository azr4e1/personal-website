Below the line marketing, also known as BTL advertising, is a highly targeted strategy where products and services are promoted in media that diverges from the traditional mainstream options. Below the line marketing advertising systems include:

- Direct mail and email campaigns
- targeted search engine marketing
- social media marketing
- trade shows and catalogues

These methods tend to be more focused and less expensive than ATL [above-the-line-marketing](/wiki/above-the-line-marketing/) systems. They are also more engaging and make the audience feel like you are speaking to them personally, improving customer relations and loyalty.
