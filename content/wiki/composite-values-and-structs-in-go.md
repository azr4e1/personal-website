A data type made up of several values that you can treat as a single unit is called a _composite type_.

A `struct` in Go groups together related pieces of data, called _fields_.

E.g.:
```go
// Customer represents information about a customer.
type Customer struct {
  Name string
  Email string
}
```

Comments before a struct definition get turned into browsable documentation when published to github.

The `type` keyword introduces a new _type definition_. The `struct` keyword specifies which kind of new type we are creating.

Everything after `type Customer ...` is a _type literal_.
