Caching is a method of storing temporary data for quick access.

We store copies of files in temporary storage location known as a _cache_.

The primary goal is to increase data retrieval performance by reducing the underlying
slower storage layer. It involves keeping a subset of data - the most frequently accessed -
in a faster storage system.
