Synthetic data is any type of artificially generated data that is created using algorithms and mathematical models rather than being collected from real-world sources.

It has been widely used since the 60s with simulations and testing purposes but has gained more prominance in recent years thanks to developments in computing power, data quality and availability, and new generative models.
