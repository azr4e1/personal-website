Scientific evidence from clinical studies in the past two decades overwhelmingly suggests there's no single, ideal or good posture. Differences in spinal postures are not related to pain. In fact, posture naturally varies from person to person.

Whily psycologically, slouching has a negative connotation, "bad postures" like this have no role in damaging spine and causing back pain.

What is important is to assume a postures that is comfortable to you, and change postures often to guarantee spine flexibility.

One area where slouching may have a negative effect is memory retention: slouching has been linked to poorer information and memory recall, as well as worse mood when compared to sitting upright.
