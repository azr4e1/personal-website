Once Google Analytics starts to receive data, the data first appears in the
Realtime report, and then in other reports shortly after. You can use the
Realtime report to confirm that data from your website is actually being
collected successfully. First, check that user traffic to your website appears
in Google Analytics. In your Analytics property, navigate to Reports, and then
Realtime. If no data is showing, open up your website or app so that you're an
active user. If data is being collected, you should see close to immediate
realtime activity in the Realtime report.

The Realtime report displays user activity that occurred in the past 30
minutes. You'll see the number of users as well as what devices are being used.
For checking that data is properly being collected, you can focus on two main
things. First, is there any activity shown in the past 30 minutes? Second,
check that the data you expect is coming into Analytics. Look at the event
count by event name card. This card shows all of the events being collected
from your tag site, such as page views and any click events that you're sending.

You can also use Google Tag Assistant and the browser extension, Tag Assistant
Companion, to determine whether your tag is implemented correctly.

Tag Assistant is a debugging tool, and the optional (but recommended) extension
provides additional debugging information when using Tag Assistant.
