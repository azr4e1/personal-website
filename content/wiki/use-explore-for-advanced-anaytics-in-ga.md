Explore is a collection of advanced analysis techniques that go beyond standard reports to uncover more insights about customer behavior. Explorations, which are the reports you can build within Explore, give you access to data and analytical techniques that aren't available in standard reports, such as funnels and pathing.

You'll have the option to start a new exploration from scratch or a template or open an existing report.

You'll see three distinct areas from left to right. First, you have the variables pane. This panel gives you access to the dimensions, metrics, and segments that you can use in an exploration. You can also change the timeframe of the exploration here and give it a name.

Next, you have the tab settings pane. Use this panel to configure the whiteboard area on the canvas. You can select the technique, add items from the variables panel, and configure technique-specific options. You can also use this tab to compare segments, select breakdowns in values, and apply filters.

And finally, the canvas, which is this large area that displays all of your data. The canvas can have multiple tabs, letting you use multiple techniques in a single exploration.

There are several pre-defined techniques you can select when exploring your data:
- Freeform
- Funnel: will help you visualize the steps users take to complete tasks on your site or your app and see how you can optimize the user experience and identify over or underperforming audiences.
- Path: visualize the path that users take as they interact with your website or your app
- Overlap: shows you how different user segments relate to each other. You can use this technique to identify new segments of users who meet complex criteria.
- Cohort:  helps you look at the behavior and performance of groups of users related by common attributes
- User lifetime: allows you to explore user behavior and value over their lifetime as a customer.


Explorations are private by default. If youâ€™re the creator, only you can view and edit them unless you choose to share.


When you first create an exploration, only you have access to it. If you create an exploration you want to share, choose the share icon in the upper right.

If someone else shares an exploration with you, you have access to view it but can't edit it. If you want to edit the exploration, create a duplicate by finding it on the Explorations homepage, choosing the three dot menu in the row for that exploration, and selecting Duplicate.

Duplicating an exploration creates a private copy that you can modify as needed.
