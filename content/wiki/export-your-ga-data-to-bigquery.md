BigQuery is a server-less, cost-effective, multicloud data warehouse designed to help you manage and analyze data with built-in features like machine learning, geospatial analysis, and business intelligence.

BigQuery lets you run SQL queries to answer your organization's biggest questions with zero infrastructure management.

You can export raw events from GA properties to BQ. You can add additional business data and answer questions based on the combined dataset.

You can export data to BQ either daily or in stream (continuously).

You can use BQ to export your GA data to external storage: first export your GA data to BQ, and from there export the data to local csv.
