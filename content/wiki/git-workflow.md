The basic Git workflow goes something like this:

1. You modify files in your working tree.
2. You selectively stage just those changes you want to be
part of your next
   commit, which adds only those changes to the staging
area.
3. You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in
the staging area and
   stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.

If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory,
itâ€™s considered committed. If it has been
modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged.
And if it was changed since it was checked
out but has not been staged, it is modified.
