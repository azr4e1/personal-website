In the mathematical area of graph theory, a directed graph is said to be aperiodic if there is no integer k >â€‰1 that divides the length of every cycle of the graph. Equivalently, a graph is aperiodic if the greatest common divisor of the lengths of its cycles is one; this greatest common divisor for a graph G is called the period of G.
