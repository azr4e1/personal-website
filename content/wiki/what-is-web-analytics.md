Digital analytics is the process of collecting, measuring and analysing data from digital sources like websites apps. You can use this to improve your marketing and business decisions.

Tools like Google Analytics empower these decisions.

The main purpose of digital analytics is to help you understand your progress toward particular business objectives.
- Decide which business objective to focus on
- Identify the metrics that drive the chosen objective at each stage of the customer journey
- Define a target metric to work toward.

E.g.
Jason sells sneakers on his website, and his business objective is to increase
profit by focusing on promoting his most profitable shoes. To help achieve
this, he wants to see how many visitors make purchases, which sneakers they
buy, and which sales are the most profitable.
