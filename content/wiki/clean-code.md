Paradigms like object-oriented programming [object-oriented-programming]] and functional programming [[functional-programming](/wiki/object-oriented-programming]] and functional programming [[functional-programming/) are all about making code easier to work with and understand as the feeble humans we are. Code that's easy for humans to understand is called "clean code".

    Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

# Clean Code Does Not

- Make your programs run faster
- Make your programs function correctly
- Only occur in object-oriented programming

# Clean code does

- Make code easier to work with
- Make it easier to find and fix bugs
- Make the development process faster
- Help us retain our sanity
