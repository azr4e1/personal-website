When you first log into Google Analytics, you'll arrive at the homepage. The homepage shows a snapshot of information that's relevant to you and your business. It will also surface reports and pages that you've recently viewed, as well as data and insights about your property.

To the left we have the navigation menu with the following sections:
- Home: you'll find information that's relevant to you and your property. The cards become more and personalized as you continue using Google Analytics.

- Reports: You'll view ready-made reports that answer common questions about how your users are interacting with your app or website.

- Explore: You can use advanced analysis techniques that go beyond the standard reports to help you uncover deeper insights about your customers' engagement, and create advanced visualizations. You can visualize data using techniques such as free form, funnels, pathing, cohort, and more. And once you've created valuable data sets, you can export them as Google Analytics segments or audiences.

- Advertising: here you can analyze, understand and improve your online advertising efforts. This will help you better understand the ROI of your advertising and marketing spend across channels. Make informed decisions about budget allocation and evaluate attribution models. To get the most out of the advertising workspace make sure to link your Google Analytics property to your Google Ads account. When you link to Google Ads, your advertising workspace reports will contain detailed Google Ads campaign data.

- Admin (bottom, cog): manage your account, properties, evenets and user settings

On the top left, you can switch accounts and properties.

The search bar will help you navigate the account and answer analytics questions.

You can also compare time periods using the selector on the top right.
