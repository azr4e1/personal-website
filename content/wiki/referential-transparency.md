Referential transparency is a property of a function that allows it to be replaced by its equivalent output. In simpler terms, if you call the function a second time with the same arguments, youâ€™re guaranteed to get the same returning value.

Pure functions are always referentially transparent.

"Referential transparency" is a fancy way of saying that a function call can be replaced by its would-be return value because it's the same every time. Referentially transparent functions can be safely memoized [memoization](/wiki/memoization/).

The great thing about pure functions is that they can always be safely memoized. Impure functions can't be because they might do something in addition to returning a static value, or they might return different values given the same arguments.
