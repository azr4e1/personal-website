# Share your GA data
You can share your Analytics data for several purposes:
- Share your Google Analytics data to help improve Google's products and services. Turning on this setting lets Google Analytics provide best-in-class Intelligence and Insights services and maintain critical spam detection services
- Contribute anonymous data to an aggregate data set to enable features like benchmarking and publications that can help you understand data trends. All identifiable information about your website is removed and combined with other anonymous data before it's shared with others.
- Let Google technical support representatives access your Google Analytics data and account when necessary to provide service and find solutions to technical issues.
- Give Google marketing and sales specialists access to your Google Analytics data and account so they can find ways to improve your configuration and analysis and share optimization tips with you.
