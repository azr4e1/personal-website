# Breadth First Search

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth before moving on to the nodes at the next depth level.
