When you have several assignments to do, Go has a nice feature to help you: the tuple assignment. A tuple is an ordered list of things.

Suppose we have three variables a, b, and c, and we want to assign them the values 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

We can write
```go
a, b, c := 1, 2, 3
```

`var x, y = 2, 3` is slightly safer to use than `x, y := 2, 3`. The former ensures that both `x` and `y` do not already exist in the _current_ scope.
