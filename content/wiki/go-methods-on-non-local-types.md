We cannot add methods to _non-local_ types, that is, types not defined in our package.

We can however create a new type that inherits from the type we want to add the method too:
```go
type MyInt int
```

Now, `MyInt` is a local type we can add methods to.
```go
func (i MyInt) Twice() MyInt {
    return i * 2
}
```

Careful that Go considers `int` and `MyInt` two distinct types. You canâ€™t pass an `int` value where a `MyInt` is expected, and vice versa.

This means we have to convert `int`s to `MyInt`s using _type conversion_:
```go
input := MyInt(9)
```

Not every type conversion is possible.
