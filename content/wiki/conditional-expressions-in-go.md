An `if` statement begins with the keyword `if`, followed by some expression that evaluates to either `true` of `false`, and then curly braces that delimit the scope of the statement.

The expression is called _conditional expressions_ because it specifies the condition under which the scope should be executed.

`true` and `false` are boolean values. In Go they have the type `bool`.
