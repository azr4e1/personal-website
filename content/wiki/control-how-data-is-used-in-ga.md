# Control how data is used in GA
GA provides data collections control to meet the privacy expectation of users across the globe:
- Disable data collection: you can partially or completely disable data collection from your digital properties
- IP Addresses: GA doesn't log or store individual IP addresses
- Data retention period: you can set the amount of time before user-level and event-level data is automatically deleted
- Consent Mode: once implemented, Google's tags will dinamically adapt based on the consent status of the users

You can also remove data from GA at any time:
- Request data deletion: If you need to delete data from the Analytics servers, you can submit a request for its removal. There's a seven-day grace period starting from the time you make the request before Analytics will begin the deletion process.
- Delete user data: You can also delete a single userâ€™s data from your Analytics account.
- Delete a property: If you have edit permission, you can delete a property from your Analytics account. Your property and all the reports and data in the property will be permanently deleted 35 days after being moved to the trash can.

The Analytics User Deletion API will allow to delete data in bulk.
